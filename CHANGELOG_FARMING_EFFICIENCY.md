# Changelog: Material Farming Efficiency Analyzer

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-11

### 🎉 NEW FEATURE: Material Farming Efficiency Analyzer

A groundbreaking new tool that revolutionizes how players plan their daily domain farming in Genshin Impact.

---

## ✨ What's New

### 🎯 Smart Domain Analysis

Added intelligent analysis system that:
- Analyzes all your bookmarked materials across characters and weapons
- Calculates efficiency scores based on material rarity and quantity
- Recommends which domains to farm for maximum resin efficiency
- Highlights domains available TODAY based on your server

### 🎨 Beautiful New UI

**New Page**: Tools → Farming Efficiency Analyzer

Features include:
- Clean, modern Material 3 design
- Color-coded material chips by rarity (5★ orange, 4★ purple, etc.)
- Efficiency score badges
- "Available Today" indicators
- Empty state with helpful guidance
- Smooth loading animations

### 🌐 Full Localization

Available in:
- 🇯🇵 Japanese (完全対応)
- 🇬🇧 English (fully supported)

### 📱 Responsive Design

Works perfectly on:
- Mobile phones (< 600dp)
- Tablets (600-840dp)
- Desktop (> 840dp)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Algorithm

```
Efficiency Score = Σ (Material Quantity × Rarity Weight)

Rarity Weights:
- 5★ materials: 1.0 (highest priority)
- 4★ materials: 0.8
- 3★ materials: 0.6
- 2★ materials: 0.4
- 1★ materials: 0.2
```

### Architecture

- **State Management**: Riverpod
- **Data Models**: Freezed (immutable)
- **UI Framework**: Flutter Material 3
- **Navigation**: go_router (type-safe)
- **Localization**: slang

### Files Added

**Implementation (7 files)**:
```
lib/models/farming_efficiency.dart
lib/models/farming_efficiency.freezed.dart
lib/providers/farming_efficiency.dart
lib/providers/farming_efficiency.g.dart
lib/pages/tools/farming_efficiency.dart
lib/routes.dart (modified)
lib/routes.g.dart (modified)
```

**Localization (2 files)**:
```
lib/i18n/ja.i18n.yaml (updated)
lib/i18n/en.i18n.yaml (updated)
```

**Navigation (1 file)**:
```
lib/pages/tools/tools.dart (updated)
```

### Performance

- ✅ O(n) algorithm complexity
- ✅ Provider result caching
- ✅ Efficient re-renders
- ✅ Lazy loading
- ✅ Minimal memory footprint
